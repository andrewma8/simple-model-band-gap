# Simple Model for Band Gap

This repository contains the code for the following paper: **"Predicting band gap from chemical composition: A simple learned model for a material property with atypical statistics"** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02932).

Please cite the above paper if you make use of this code.

The data in this repository is a processed version of a dataset available in MatBench (https://matbench.materialsproject.org/) that was originally curated by Zhuo et al. (2018).  If you make use of the data, please also cite the following two papers: (1) "Benchmarking materials property prediction methods: the Matbench test set and Automatminer reference algorithm" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00406-3) and (2) "Predicting the band gaps of inorganic solids by machine learning" (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00124).
